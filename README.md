### About
The proj_med repository appears to be a data-driven project focused on medical/healthcare analytics or predictive modeling. It likely involves processing medical datasets, training machine learning models, and generating insights for healthcare applications.

Key Components:

Data Preprocessing: Includes scripts for cleaning, transforming, and structuring raw medical data (e.g., CSV files).

Model Development: Contains code for training machine learning models (potentially for tasks like disease prediction or patient risk stratification).

Utilities: Helper functions for tasks like feature engineering, evaluation metrics, or visualization.

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, or result demonstration.
